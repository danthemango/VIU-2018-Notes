#+TITLE: Emacs
* EMACS
** About
Emacs is a text editor, which is known for it's many modules and source-code editing tools. Check out the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/][Emacs Tour]] for some tutorials on getting started.

To start emacs just type 'emacs' in the command line, or type
  - 'emacs (filename)' to immediately open a file called (filename)
  - 'emacs (filename) &' to open emacs with a file and send to background
    - (background means not taking over the terminal window)
    - Note: do not use '&' via ssh

Special keys and key modifiers:
| Symbol        | Meaning                     |
|---------------+-----------------------------|
| C-            | Control-                    |
| M-            | Alt- (or 'Meta-' or 'Esc-') |
| (RET)         | Enter / Return              |
| (BS) or (DEL) | Backspace                   |
| (delete)      | Delete key                  |
| (SPC)         | Spacebar                    |
| (TAB)         | Tab key                     |
| (cmd)         | A named command             |

Note that many commands require multiple sequences of keys, which may require you to let go of control/alt to finish the sequence. For example:
    - 'C-x C-b' means "Control and x, then control and b"
    - 'C-x b' which  means "control and x, then just b"

** Org Mode
*** Org Mode Basics
- [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/02/learn-take-notes-efficiently-org-mode/][More about org-mode]]
Org mode is great for note taking, checklists and project management. Start a project in org mode by opening a file with a '.org' extension. Here are a few things you can do:

: * top-heading
: ** subheading
: some text
:
: new paragraph
: - list item
:     - sub list-item
: - [ ] checklist item
: [[https://github.com/danthemango/][a website]]

Here are a few commands used to manage org-mode headings and lists:
| Command           | description                                         |
|-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| (TAB)             | expand/contract elements in subheading              |
| S-(TAB)           | expand/contract every heading                       |
| C-c C-n / C-c C-p | jump to next / previous heading                     |
| C-c C-f / C-c C-b | jump to next / previous heading at same level       |
| C-c C-u           | jump 'up' heading (higher level)                    |
| S-(down) / S-(up) | jump to next / previous line item                   |
| M-(Ret)           | insert new heading / item                           |
| M-S-(RET)         | insert new checklist item                           |
| C-c ^             | sort list                                           |
| C-c C-c           | mark item in list as sorted                         |
| C-c C-e           | export notes (e.g. use 'h h' to export to html) [1] |
Go to 'M-x customize-option org-export-backends' to get a list of possible export options

*** org-tables
[[http://orgmode.org/guide/Tables.html][Tables in org-mode]]

Emacs org-mode has some amazing support for creating and maintaining tables in notes. To create a table, simply start subdividing sections of text between '|' characters. So, start by typing the following characters:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
|-
|heading 1 | heading 2
|-
| one | two 
| three | four 
#+END_EXAMPLE

push tab, and you should see:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
|-----------+-----------|
| heading 1 | heading 2 |
|-----------+-----------|
| one       | two       |
| three     | four      |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Shortcuts for working with org-tables:
| command         | description                                   |
|-----------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| C-u 2 C-c       | create table, columns separated by two spaces |
| (TAB)           | move to next cell                             |
| S-(TAB)         | move to previous cell                         |
| M-(direction)   | move row / column in (direction)              |
| M-S-(direction) | insert now row / column in table              |
| S-(RET)         | increment previous value in below row         |

*** [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Easy-templates.html][org-mode templates]]
**** [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-examples.html][org-mode example-templates]]
Type '<e' at the start of a line and push tab to open up a literal example. This will insert the text which indicates to org-mode that the text within that block is to be interpreted literally.
Use ':' at the start of a line to do it only on one line. E.g.:
: : this is a literal example

**** org-mode code-template
at the beginning of the line type: <s, push tab, and you should end up with:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC 

#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE
which can be used in the following way to create code segments with syntax highlighting:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
   printf("hello world\n");
}
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

which looks like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
   printf("hello world\n");
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: hello world

***** running code
With [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][org-babel]], some languages can be interpreted in-place without leaving your org-mode file. To enable a language, use M-x 'customize', search for 'Org Babel Load Languages', add and enable any languages you want. [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_org_babel_literate_programing.html][More Info]].

After enabling the C language for example, org mode prints the following after pushing C-c C-c on top of the source code above:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+RESULTS:
: hello world
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** org-mode code
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC python
return 1 + 3
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4
#+END_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
   printf("hello world\n");
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: hello world

or use ':session' to run it as though you're in an interpreter
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
1 + 3
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html#Export-settings][org-mode exporting]]

org-mode formatted files can be exported in pdf, html, md, and other formats. [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html][How to build a Block with org-mode]].

** Bookmarks

1. customizations are installed to ~/.emacs.d/ and loaded via ~/.emacs
2. from with 'term' you need to use other buttons to move around:
  - use 'C-c b' to switch buffers rather than the standard 'C-x b'
  - use 'C-c C-c' to cancel program execution rather than the standard 'C-c'
- will not do multiple terminals, consider installing multi-term
3.  almost a regular shell, but also accepts emacs commands (and lisp) 
  - e.g. (+ 2 2)
4.  use 'emacs -f desktop-read' to open it with that previous session 
5.  melpa is a package which expands this list
6.  use 'C-h v' to check the state of an emacs variable

** Dir mode
- dir mode is used in an opened directory
- e.g.: use C-x C-f ~ (RET) to open the home directory
| key       | description                  |
|-----------+------------------------------|
| n / p     | move down / up               |
| f / (RET) | open file or directory       |
| h         | help                         |
| ?         | quick help                   |
| ^         | go up directory              |
| +         | create new directory         |
| q         | quit                         |
| shift+c   | copy file                    |
| shift+a   | grep (search through) files  |
| shift+r   | rename file                  |
| s         | re-sort files                |
| m         | mark file                    |
| !         | run shell command on file(s) |
| d         | mark for deletion            |
| x         | (execute) run deletion       |
| u         | unmark                       |

** Packages I've installed
- melpa
  - provides extra packages
- nyan-cat 
  - novelty scroll-bar (M-x nyan-mode)
- server-mode
  - automatically start emacs server mode with a call to 'emacsclient'
- base16-monokai
  - looks great for most modes
  - set via M-x customize-themes
- jekyll-modes
  - Helps with editing jekyll blog projects.
- octopress
  - Helps with editing octopress website projects.
- dired-details.el
  - dired-hide-details-mode
  - hides the details from directories in dired mode (toggle with '(')

** Lisp
| command       | description                            |
|---------------+----------------------------------------|
| M-x lisp-mode | enter lisp-mode                        |
| M-:           | evaluate lisp expression in minibuffer |
| C-x C-e       | evaluate lisp expression before cursor |
- consider entering lisp interactive mode to debug lisp
- C-u <Esc> C-x enters edebug more for lisp-interactive-mode
*** slime mode
I'm actually using [[https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][SLIME mode]] for better lisp interpreting (emacs lisp was designed to be weaker than common lisp)
** Running emacs commands from the command line
Use 'emacs --batch -f command' from the command line if you want to run the equivalent of an M-x command without opening emacs.

For example I sometimes use the following command to compile org-mode files to emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
emacs myfile.org --batch -f org-html-export-to-html
#+END_SRC
Also append '--kill' if the command is not designed to stop emacs on its own.
** Other
I watched [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxj9UAX4Em-IiOfvF2Qs742LxEK4owSkr][this video series]] to get started on emacs, and besides the man-pages and org-mode website I found [[http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs210/help/emacs.html][this page]] pretty useful.
