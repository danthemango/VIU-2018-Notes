* EMACS
- https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/ has a good overview of emacs capabilities
- to start emacs just type 'emacs' in the command line
  - use 'emacs (filename)' to immediately open a file called (filename)
  - use 'emacs (filename) &' to open emacs with a file and send to background
    - (background means not taking over the terminal window)
    - Note: do not use '&' via ssh
- special keys and key modifiers:
| Symbol        | Meaning                     |
|---------------+-----------------------------|
| C-            | Control-                    |
| M-            | Alt- (or 'Meta-' or 'Esc-') |
| (RET)         | Enter / Return              |
| (BS) or (DEL) | Backspace                   |
| (delete)      | Delete key                  |
| (SPC)         | Spacebar                    |
| (TAB)         | Tab key                     |
| (cmd)         | A named command             |
- note: many commands require multiple sequences of keys, which may require you to let go of control/alt to finish the sequence. For example:
    - 'C-x C-b' means "Control and x, then control and b"
    - 'C-x b' which  means "control and x, then just b"

** Basics
| C-g 	          | cancel command                       |
| C-x C-f          | open file                            |
| C-x C-s		    | save file                            |
| C-x C-w		    | save as ..                           |
| C-x C-c		    | close emacs                          |
| C-/       		 | undo                                 |
| C-g C-/          | redo [1]                             |
| C-(SPC)          | start / end selection [2]            |
| M-w              | copy selection                       |
| C-w              | cut selection (i.e. copy and delete) |
| C-y              | paste                                |
| C-x b            | switch to buffer [3]                 |
| C-x k            | kill a buffer                        |
| C-x C-b          | list buffers                         |
- [1] C-/ becomes 'redo again' and C-g C-/ becomes 'undo after redo'
- [2] or just drag with the mouse             
- [3] 'buffer' means 'opened file'
- use 'M-x xterm-mouse-mode' to turn on the mouse via ssh
- use 'M-x tetris' to start playing tetris

** Window commands
you can quickly edit multiple files at once by splitting the current emacs session into multiple frames:
| C-x 0 | close current frame      |
| C-x 1 | close all other frames   |
| C-x 2 | create horizontal frame  |
| C-x 3 | create vertical frame    |
| C-x o | switch to 'other' window |
- note: use C-(up and C-(down) to cycle through the history of commands in that case

** Extras
| C-x (TAB) | indent/dedent entire region                |
| M-y       | cycle through previous yanks (after paste) |

** Org mode
- org mode is great for note taking, checklists and project management
- use 'M-x org-mode' to enter org mode, or just open a file named (filename).org
- use '\*' to indicate a header, and include '\*\*' to make a subheader
- use '- [ ] item' to create a checklist item called 'item'
- use '[/]' on the header to keep track of items used in sublist

| S-(TAB)           | expand/contract every heading                       |

| C-c C-e           | export notes (e.g. use 'h h' to export to html) [1] |
1. go to 'M-x customize-option org-export-backends' to get a list of possible export options
*** org-tables
- for more info: http://orgmode.org/guide/Tables.html
- emacs org mode has some amazing support for creating and maintaining tables in notes
- to create a table, simply start subdividing sections of text between '|' characters
| command         | description                                   |
|-----------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| C-u 2 C-c       | create table, columns separated by two spaces |
| (TAB)           | move to next cell                             |
| S-(TAB)         | move to previous cell                         |
| M-(direction)   | move row / column in (direction)              |
| M-S-(direction) | insert now row / column in table              |
| S-(RET)         | increment previous value in below row         |

*** org-mode templates
- https://orgmode.org/manual/Easy-templates.html
- use #+BEGIN_SRC C++ and #+END_SRC to get nicely-formatted code segments
- use '<s tab' to quickly insert code-block segment
*** org-mode exporting
- http://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html#Export-settings
- org-mode formatted files can be exported in pdf, html, md, and other formats
** Bookmarks
| C-x r m | mark bookmark          |
| C-x r b | jump to named bookmark |
| C-x r l | list all bookmarks     |

|-----------+-------------------------|
| M-x (cmd) | run named command       |
| M-x (TAB) | list all named commands |
| C-h f     | help with named command |

1. customizations are installed to ~/.emacs.d/ and loaded via ~/.emacs
2. from with 'term' you need to use other buttons to move around:
  - use 'C-c b' to switch buffers rather than the standard 'C-x b'
  - use 'C-c C-c' to cancel program execution rather than the standard 'C-c'
- will not do multiple terminals, consider installing multi-term
3.  almost a regular shell, but also accepts emacs commands (and lisp) 
  - e.g. (+ 2 2)
4.  use 'emacs -f desktop-read' to open it with that previous session 
5.  melpa is a package which expands this list
6.  use 'C-h v' to check the state of an emacs variable

** Dir mode
- dir mode is used in an opened directory
- e.g.: use C-x C-f ~ (RET) to open the home directory
| key       | description                  |
|-----------+------------------------------|
| n / p     | move down / up               |
| f / (RET) | open file or directory       |
| h         | help                         |
| ?         | quick help                   |
| ^         | go up directory              |

|---------------+----------------------------------------|
| M-x lisp-mode | use lisp-mode                          |
| M-:           | evaluate lisp expression in minibuffer |
| C-x C-e       | evaluate lisp expression before cursor |
** Running emacs commands from the command line
- running `emacs --batch -f command` will run an emacs command without necessarily opening emacs
- (append --kill in case it is a command which does not quit on its own)
  - e.g. I use the following command to compile an org-mode file to html: `emacs myfile.org --batch -f org-html-export-to-html`
